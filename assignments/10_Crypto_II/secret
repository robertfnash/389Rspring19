hello! if you're reading this, then you've successfully decrypted this message

your flag is: CMSC389R-{m3ss@g3_!n_A_b0ttl3}

mention this flag in your part 1 writeup!

your directions:
type `gpg --list-secret-keys` and take a screenshot to verify that this
`key.asc` file has been properly imported.

next, create a text file called `signature.txt` and write the following inside:

"My name is <your name here>!"

replacing the <your name here> part with your actual name.

Once you've created this file, use `gpg` to sign the file with this new imported
keyand output it as `signature.txt.asc`. make sure to use the `--clearsign`
flag to produce an ASCII-armored output.

Upload only the `signature.txt.asc` file, and make sure it is named as such,
otherwise the grading script will NOT find it and properly, and you will not
receive credit for this part.
