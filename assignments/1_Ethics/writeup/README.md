### Part 2 (75 pts)

When considering an ethical dilemma such as the one proposed, an individual does not have to look far into history to see that ignoring such an issue could cause catastrophic damage to not only human life, but to the company's reputation and ultimately their bottom line.

In the 1970's, the Ford Pinto was an American answer to the growing popularity of the smaller Japanese cars. In an attempt to meet aggressive price points and delivery deadlines, a fuel tank design flaw was discovered and ignored. This flaw caused the car to explode after low-speed impacts from the rear. An $11 per car fix was calculated to be more than just paying out potential lawsuits so the car was produced without a fix. Approximately 180 people died from this and although Ford didn't lose a lot of money directly, the PR from this drove consumers away for years and cost a lot more in lost sales to the foreign cars they were competing with.

Another catastrophic event was the 1986 explosion of the Challenger spacecraft after only 73 seconds of flight. Despite an engineer advising management against launching the spacecraft in such cold temperatures, the decision to launch was made and 7 people, including one civilian died. Not only did this lead to a loss of life, but millions of dollars in time and equipment was lost in 73 seconds, because pressures to not delay the launch were put above safety.

If I were a junior developer working on an ECU, I believe it would be my ethical duty to inform all necessary parties the risks and possible consequences of not fixing the vulnerabilities within the firmware. Proper chain of command should be followed, and a thorough investigation should be conducted to decide whether or not the vulnerabilities are there and if the risk is real. If it is discovered the risks are real and the company decides to do nothing, it may be appropriate to go to outside sources. This may result in loss of job and other retaliation, however not is it only the developer’s ethical obligation, the developer may be charged with gross negligence if a tragedy happens and it is discovered he/she had knowledge, and nothing was done. A good lawyer may be needed. The NSPE, National Society of Professional Engineers, has developed a code of ethics that can be referred to and can help those that aren’t sure. 

In short, a developer should always serve with the public’s best interest in mind while still acting as a faithful agent to his/her employer. Should his/her employer insist against the interest of the public, then that developer has a duty to disclose that information to the public as long as it is truthful and lawful. History has a habit of repeating itself.
